      I found my love for computers back when I was 4 years old and played Age
      of Empires III and Starcraft with my dad. From there, I became more
      involved with technology with minecraft servers and plugins. I began
      learning how to code during COVID, and have been hooked ever since.

      <br />
      <br />
      I am currently working on my BS at the
      <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/" class="link">University of Buffalo</a>,
      as well as interning at a
      <a href="https://www.linde.com/about-us" class="link"
        >Fortune 500 company</a
      >
      as a Full Stack Software Engineer. At UB, some of my favorite classes were
      Distributed Systems, Web Apps and Security, and Data-Intensive Computing.
      I am also a member UB Hacking, having fun making projects with friends.
